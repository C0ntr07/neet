A quick note: Neet runs on Linux, and is unlikely to work on other operating
systems - I've never tested it on anything else. It most definitely won't work
on Windows, and it's unlikely to work under Cygwin. If you normally use
another OS, just grab yourself a Kali Linux ISO and build yourself a Kali VM
in which to install Neet. It will make life far easier.

Neet has a significant number of dependencies, largely thanks to the modules
which test various services. However, the installer takes care of most of
the dependency checking for you - if you have missing dependencies then 
these will be listed so you can get them from source or using your package
manager of choice.

Missing critical dependencies will stop the installation. You can redo the
installation once you have satisfied the critical requirements.

Recommended dependencies will trigger warnings if they are missing, and
they may well break some functionality, but Neet will continue to function.
These will not stop installation, but will be listed in a text file for
you to resolve.

  ** IMPORTANT **
  If you have installed neet and there are unresolved dependencies, run
  /opt/neet/bin/updateLocations once you have resolved them. This will
  ensure that the functionality for which they are required will be
  configured to use them.

Having said all that, installation of Neet is pretty simple on most
modern distributions, and if you use Kali or Backtrack, the installer
will pre-fetch certain dependencies for you as long as you have a 
working Internet connection that your package manager can use. In these
cases installation is an extremely simple process.

In all cases, start the installation process by changing into the
"install" directory and running "./install.sh" as root.
