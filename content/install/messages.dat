::Nmap:critical
 Nmap is the core port-scanning engine and as such, it is a critical component.

::Nmap:recommended
 Nmap performs a number of important tasks, such as service identification and
 a number of vulnerability checks. It is important to have the latest version
 detection fingerprints and scripting engine in order to get the best out of
 Neet.

::TCPTraceroute:recommended
 TCPTraceroute is used by the topology scanning module.

::Amap:recommended
 Amap is used to identify services which the Nmap service identification module
 has failed to identify accurately.

::OpenVAS-LIBNASL:recommended
 OpenVAS NASL is an open-source project which forked from the Nessus 2 development
 when Nessus 3.x ceased to be open source. Whilst the Neet discovery engine is not 
 intended to replace vulnerability scanners such as Nessus, it uses OpenVAS LIBNASL
 to determine the presence of serious vulnerabilities which Neet is capable of
 exploiting.

::Hydra:recommended
 THC Hydra is used for brute-force-guessing passwords for a number of authentication
 mechanisms, including MySQL, MSSQL, Windows and SSH.

::Bannergrab:recommended
 Bannergrab is used to obtain banner information from remote services. The discovery
 engine compares this banner information with known signatures in order to determine
 which services are listening on open ports.

::Dig:recommended
 Dig is a powerful tool for investigating DNS.

::RPCClient:recommended
 RPCClient is a part of the Samba suite, and is a tool for executing client-side
 RPC functions. It is used extensively by the discovery engine to enumerate data
 from Windows and Samba servers.

::Net:recommended
 Net is a part of the Samba suite, and is used extensively by the discovery
 engine to interact with Windows and Samba servers.

::Net-SNMP:recommended
 Net-SNMP is used by the discovery engine to enumerate SNMP data from servers.
 The discovery engine will not be able to dump SNMP MIBs without this tool set.

::Ruby:recommended
 Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity
 and productivity. It is used by the Metasploit Framework, which is used by the
 exploitation module of the Pentest Power Console.

::Net-ARP:recommended
 Net::ARP is used by fwdetect to determine which interfaces will forward packets. It
 can be downloaded and compiled from http://www.cpan.org. Alternatively, the cpan 
 command-line tool will fetch the module and any of its dependencies for you directly
 from the CPAN if you have Internet access, or install it from your distribution's
 package repositories.

::Net-RawIP:recommended
 Net::RawIP is used by fwdetect to determine which interfaces will forward packets. It
 can be downloaded and compiled from http://www.cpan.org. Alternatively, the cpan 
 command-line tool will fetch the module and any of its dependencies for you directly
 from the CPAN if you have Internet access, or install it from your distribution's
 package repositories.

::DBD-Sybase:recommended
 DBD-Sybase is used by Neet to create a Windows shell when connected to MS-SQL databases.
 It can be downloaded and compiled from http://www.cpan.org. Alternatively, the cpan 
 command-line tool will fetch the module and any of its dependencies for you directly
 from the CPAN if you have Internet access, or install it from your distribution's
 package repositories.

::DBI:recommended
 DBI is used by Neet to create a Windows shell when connected to MS-SQL databases. It
 is also used by the credential manager.
 It can be downloaded and compiled from http://www.cpan.org. Alternatively, the cpan 
 command-line tool will fetch the module and any of its dependencies for you directly
 from the CPAN if you have Internet access, or install it from your distribution's
 package repositories.

::NetAddr-IP:critical
 NetAddr::IP is used by the discovery engine to determine which interface is 
 appropriate to use to route to each target. It is also used to perform address range
 conversions. The discovery engine will not work without this core module.
 It can be downloaded and compiled from http://www.cpan.org. Alternatively, the cpan 
 command-line tool will fetch the module and any of its dependencies for you directly
 from the CPAN if you have Internet access, or install it from your distribution's
 package repositories.

::Net-Pcap:recommended
 This module is required by the Net::PcapUtils module.
 It can be downloaded and compiled from http://www.cpan.org. Alternatively, the cpan 
 command-line tool will fetch the module and any of its dependencies for you directly
 from the CPAN if you have Internet access, or install it from your distribution's
 package repositories.

::Net-PcapUtils:recommended
 This module is required by fwdetect to determine which interfaces will forward packets.
 It can be downloaded and compiled from http://www.cpan.org. Alternatively, the cpan 
 command-line tool will fetch the module and any of its dependencies for you directly
 from the CPAN if you have Internet access.

::Term-ReadKey:critical
 This module is required to provide user interaction.

::XML-Parser:critical
 This module is required to parse the results of some test tools, including nmap.
 It can be downloaded and compiled from http://www.cpan.org. Alternatively, the cpan 
 command-line tool will fetch the module and any of its dependencies for you directly
 from the CPAN if you have Internet access.

::XML-Twig:critical
 This module is require to parse the results of some test tools, including nmap.
 It can be downloaded and compiled from http://www.cpan.org. Alternatively, the cpan 
 command-line tool will fetch the module and any of its dependencies for you directly
 from the CPAN if you have Internet access.

::IO-Socket-SSL:recommended
 This module is required for testing of some services which are accessed through SSL.
 It can be downloaded and compiled from http://www.cpan.org. Alternatively, the cpan 
 command-line tool will fetch the module and any of its dependencies for you directly
 from the CPAN if you have Internet access, or install it from your distribution's
 package repositories.

::DBD-SQLite:recommended
 This module is required for the credential manager. If you don't have this module,
 you'll see some ugly output while running Neet, and the various modules will not be
 able to store and share credentials in a meaningful way.
 It can be downloaded and compiled from http://www.cpan.org. Alternatively, the cpan 
 command-line tool will fetch the module and any of its dependencies for you directly
 from the CPAN if you have Internet access, or install it from your distribution's
 package repositories.
