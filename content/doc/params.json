{"name":"Neet","tagline":"Neet - Network Enumeration and Exploitation Tool","body":"Neet is aimed at professional penetration testers, internal IT security teams and network administrators who wish to know more about what's actually on their network infrastructure, You might want to try it out if you fall into one of those categories.\r\n\r\nIt has been written (and continues to be developed) by a professional penetration tester over years of engagements, and has been designed explicitly to do the leg-work for you and to make it convenient and safe to get your hands on useful network information before the customer brings your first cup of tea of the day.\r\n\r\nNeet has a simple (though powerful and flexible) command-line interface, and gathers a lot of data about the network within its scope. It will give you an up-to-the second view of how many services it's found on the network, what types of services they are, what types of hosts, what their hostnames are, whether they belong to domains, etc. If the modules are enabled (as they are by default) then it will perform tests against certain services - looking for default SNMP community strings and enumerating whatever is possible from SMB services, for example. It will also check for glaring security vulnerabilities and allow you to exploit them if you so choose.\r\n\r\nIt's not magic, but it does what it says on the tin: network enumeration and exploitation. All the information gathered is stored in plain text files, so they can be grepped and awked as the user sees fit, although as well as storing the raw data, it does aggregate a lot of it into files of related information for easy processing.\r\n\r\nThere's also a customised shell which takes a lot of the common tasks you'd normally perform and rolls them into simple tasks. For example, the win command lists the Windows hosts on the network, and cross-references them against issues and vulnerabilities found to give you a colour-coded list of live hosts.\r\n\r\nAnd there's documentation too! Check out the man pages, the help command inside the neet shell, and the HTML Wiki document in /opt/neet/doc. Also, please check out [the wiki](https://github.com/JonnyHightower/neet/wiki) for the latest news and issue tracking/feature requests.\r\n\r\n###In other words...\r\n\r\nNeet is a flexible, multi-threaded network penetration test tool which runs on Linux and co-ordinates the use of numerous other open-source network tools to gather as much network information as possible in an easily-understood format. The core identifies network services, the modules test or enumerate those services, and the neet shell provides an integrated environment for processing the results and exploiting known vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nAs such, Neet sits somewhere between manually running your own port scans and subsequent tests, and running a fully automated VA tool. Neet has many options which allow the user to tune the test parameters for network scanning in the most reliable and practical way.\r\n\r\nNeet is not a point-and-click hacking or vulnerability assessment tool. It is a console-based environment best run under X Windows, designed for the operator to gain a great deal of insight into the operation of the network under test. It is also designed to help reporting by gathering as much evidence as possible. \r\n\r\nOwing to the number of open-source tools orchestrated by Neet, the installation process will check the target system to ensure that it has the tools required.\r\n\r\n***\r\nNeet is released under version 3 of the GNU Public License.
