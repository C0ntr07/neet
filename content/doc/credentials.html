<h2>The credential manager.</h2>
<p>
The credential manager is a system for storing, sorting and retrieving all the credentials you come across in a pentest.
The core is an SQLite database and an API providing the management functionality to the Neet components. User access to the
credential store is via the <i>accounts</i> tool, which can be used to access all of the management functionality. For
a quick start, the <i>accounts</i> usage information is shown below. A more comprehensive description of the credential manager will
follow at some point when I have time to write it!
</p>

<pre>
Accounts is a command-line interface to the Neet credential manager,
which is used by Neet to store and retrieve credentials found during
pentests.

You can use this command-line tool to manually manage credentials you
find or are given during a pentest, and to interact with those that Neet
finds. It allows you to add, search, modify and delete credentials, as
well as import and export them in various useful formats.

Examples of use cases are listed at the end of this help.

Usage: accounts [options]

       Use with no arguments will assume the behaviour of the -l (--list)
       option, listing all stored credentials in CSV format.

    -f (--file): use the specified file instead of the default, which is
       $HOME/.credentialManager. You can alternatively set the CREDSTORE
       environment variable, which should contain the full absolute path
       to the database file you wish to use.

    -t (--type): specify the type of credential you are adding or listing.
       Guidance on the use of this field is provided below. This field is
       always stored and searched in lower case.

    -d (--domain): specify the realm or domain of the credential you are
       adding or listing. This can also be used to specify SIDs or other
       authentication zones depending on the type of system. This is a
       case-sensitive field.

    -u (--user): specify the account name of the credential you are adding
       or listing. If the username is supplied in user@domain or DOMAIN\USER
       format, both the "user" and "domain" fields are populated correctly.
       This also applies to specification of usernames and domains whilst
       searching. This is a case-sensitive field.

    -p (--pass): specify the password of the credential you are adding or
       listing. This is a case-sensitive field.

    -s (--system): specify the system name or IP address for the credential
       you are adding or listing. This field is always stored and searched
       in UPPER case.

    -g (--tag): provide a tag for your credential. For example, WCE can have
       "hist01", "current" and "used" for each credential. The pwdump
       import makes use of tags to store this data and you can use it to select
       data too. Tags are always stored and searched in lower case.

    -r (--rid): specify the RID or numeric identifier of the credential you are
       adding or listing. This is a case-sensitive field to facilitate storage
       of database SIDs if you so wish.

    -P (--privilege): provide a privilege indicator for your credential. For
       example, you could mark certain accounts as "high" or "low",
       "locked" or whatever you want. This field is always stored in lower
       case.

    -x (--delete): delete the credential with the specified ID

    -m (--modify): modify the credential with the specified ID. You can
       update the existing data for the credential by specifying any of the
       -u -p -P -t -g -d -s -c or -r parameters, exactly as though you were
       adding a new credential.

    -l (--list): list stored credentials. You can optionally filter results
       by specifying -t -d -u -p -s -g -r -c and/or -P to list credentials
       matching those fields only. You can use the percent (%) symbol as a
       wildcard character when matching particular fields. The output of -l can
       be formatted using --output, below.

    -o (--output): A string representing the fields that are required when
       listing the credentials:
       i = credential ID (internal reference only, but required for deleting)
       t = credential type
       r = RID or system numeric user ID
       u = username
       p = password
       d = domain/realm
       s = system name
       c = comment
       g = tag
       P = privilege

       The --output parameter is optional - without it, -l will list all the
       available fields.

    -i (--import): import a set of credentials from STDIN. This option requires
       an argument which specifies the type of list being provided. The
       following values can be supplied:

       f[tupdscgrP] = This signifies a CSV format import, with the input file
         having only the specified fields are in the order listed, as per the
         --output option. Use this to import general password lists in CSV
         format. If you don't have all parameters in the CSV file (perhaps
         you just have a list of passwords), then you can specify other 
         parameters on the command line as though you were manually adding
         a credential. These parameters will be applied to every credential
         imported in this way. The delimiter is a comma, although you can 
         change this with the -D option.

       pwdump = The input is in pwdump format.

       native = The credentials are being provided by the output of this program
         in export mode: "accounts -e" or "accounts --export".
         It is important that no --output filters are applied to the export,
         although the search filters can of course have been used to restrict
         the number of fields which were exported.
         This feature is useful for transferring credentials between credential
         manager databases.

    -D (--delimiter): specify the delimiter for the output (or import). The
       default delimiter is a comma.

    -e (--export): provide the output in machine-readable format, ready to be
       imported to another credential manager file by accounts.

    -L (--long): provide the output in a long format

    -q (--quotes): quote each output field. Nice for preserving integrity, not
       so nice for quick shell scripts.

    -h (--help): print this help

You are free to make up your own 'type' identifiers, but bear in mind that the
Neet modules can only make use of those of which they are aware, and that you may
need to remember them when searching through your credential store.

You don't have to add all possible fields when adding credentials. You MUST put in
either a password or username, but that is the only entry that is required to create
a new credential record.
Bear in mind that the more fields you add, the more selective you can be afterwards
when you're searching through hundreds or thousands of credentials. However, it is
possible to add further information to a credential later on, using the --modify
option.

EXAMPLES
========

0. View all credentials in the store, in shell-script-friendly CSV format
