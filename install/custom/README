Using this directory, you can add your own local extensions to neet.

CURRENTLY, ONLY THE NEET SHELL USES THIS DIRECTORY.

To add your own extensions:
	1) Create a directory - the name is unimportant but should reflect your
        orgainsation name or the purpose of the extensions contained within.
        All your content should reside within this directory.
	2) To extend the neet shell, add your shell functions to a file called
        neetshellext. This will be sourced at the end of the neet shell loading
        phase. Your code will be merged with that already comprising the 
        neet shell.
	3) If you want to provide on-line help for your neet shell extensions,
        put the help as text with a file called neetshellhelp. This will then
        be displayed with the "help" command after the main neet help
        content.
